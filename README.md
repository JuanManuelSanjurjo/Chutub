## Chutube, Youtube clone

This project is a responsive clone of YouTube, built using React. It features default tabs filled with content and a functional search feature. The application displays video cards (and layout) similar to the original design, and upon clicking, it redirects to the video playback view. Here, the same video, suggested videos, and received comments are displayed.

The application uses data provided by the API published on RapidAPI at https://youtube-v31.p.rapidapi.com. This makes the project a practical demonstration of how to use APIs to fetch and display data in a real-world application.

In summary, this project showcases responsive design, interactive web application using React and handling API data.
